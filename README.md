# Telegrambot

A simple telegram bot that dispenses  random dog pictures on typing /bop.

I have used the random API generator from:

1. http://random.dog/woof.json for dogs

2. https://some-random-api.ml/img/cat for cats

3. https://some-random-api.ml/img/birb for birds

If you want to try it out yourself then you need BOT_TOKEN given by Botfather when you create a new bot.

The app has been hosted on heroku.
